- 👋 Hi, I’m @bio-lumi, aka L U Martin.
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding how social interactions between microbes shape microbial communities, and how we can manipulate these interactions to create beneficial microbial consortia for a rapidly changing world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning metabarcoding analysis and microbial network analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything regarding how microbial communities are structured. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email [l.martin23@imperial.ac.uk or loveline.ubung@gmail.com]
- ⚡ In my spare time, I like reading speculative fiction and tabletop role playing!
